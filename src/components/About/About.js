      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a results-oriented Computer Science graduate from Northern Arizona University with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative software development.
        My academic journey has equipped me with hands-on experience in developing creative solutions, such as the Gamified Language Data Explorer, where I collaborated with a
        team to build an engaging platform that combines language learning with interactive games, powered by audio corpus exploration tools. <br /> <br />

        With a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and artificial intelligence, I thrive in environments that challenge me to think critically and develop impactful
        solutions. I am particularly drawn to opportunities in software engineering and development, where I can apply my technical expertise and creativity to tackle exciting new 
        challenges. <br /> <br />

        I am eager to join a forward-thinking team where I can contribute to meaningful projects, grow as a professional, and make a difference through technology. Letâ€™s connect
        to discuss how I can bring value to your organization!
