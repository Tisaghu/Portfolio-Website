      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
          I'm a Computer Science graduate from Northern Arizona University with a strong interest in building useful, well-designed software. I've worked on projects ranging from full-stack web apps to machine learning support tools, and I enjoy solving complex problems with simple, practical code. <br></br><br></br>

          During school, I helped build a Gamified Language Data Explorer—a team project combining PHP, SQL, and interactive design to explore an audio-text corpus. It gave me experience working with real-world data and collaborating across disciplines. <br></br><br></br>

          Since graduating, I’ve taken on roles that gave me hands-on experience with both hardware and software. I’ve written internal tools to automate workflows, supported large-scale infrastructure, and continued building projects in Flask, React, and other technologies. <br></br><br></br>

          My current stack includes Python, JavaScript, Flask, React, SQL, and Bash, but I'm always learning and trying out new tools when I can. I value clean code, clear communication, and being part of teams where people help each other grow. <br></br><br></br>

          Right now, I’m looking for a development role where I can keep learning, contribute to real projects, and grow as part of a team. I’m open to front end, back end, or full stack opportunities. I'm based near Seattle and open to remote work, but not looking to relocate. <br></br><br></br>

          If you’re working on something interesting and think I might be a good fit, feel free to reach out.
