      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science graduate from Northern Arizona University with a strong interest in building useful, well-designed software. I've worked on projects ranging from full-stack web apps to machine learning support tools, and I enjoy finding simple solutions to complex problems. <br></br><br></br>

        During school, I helped build a Gamified Language Data Explorer—a team project that combined interactive design, PHP, and SQL to explore an audio-text corpus. It taught me a lot about working with real-world data and collaborating across disciplines. <br></br><br></br>

        Since graduating, I’ve worked in tech roles that gave me hands-on experience with both hardware and software. I’ve built internal tools to automate workflows, supported large-scale infrastructure, and continued developing personal projects in Flask, React, and other technologies.

        Right now, I’m focused on growing as a developer, contributing to meaningful projects, and learning as much as I can from the people around me. If you’re working on something cool and think I might be a good fit, feel free to reach out.
